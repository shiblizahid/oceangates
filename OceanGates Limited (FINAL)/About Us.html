                    In 2009, Stockton Rush, a successful businessman with close ties to the aerospace and technology
                    industries, founded OceanGate Inc., an ocean exploration venture focused on <br>providing crewed
                    submersible <br>services to enable researchers and explorers to access the oceans' vast resources.
                    Taking an early lead in an emerging market, Stockton recognized <br>that private industry funding
                    and
                    utilization of modern materials could have a major impact on our ability to explore the deep oceans
                    while significantly lowering the cost of discovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the first two-and-a-half years of operations, using a disciplined cost/benefit analysis,
                    Stockton evaluated undersea

                    vehicles, various support vessels, and multiple pieces of support equipment. OceanGate acquired a
                    second submersible in 2012 and rebuilt it into Cyclops 1 to serve as working prototype for Titan.

                    Our highest priority during our early dives was the development of detailed operations, maintenance,
                    and safety manuals for our crew and equipment that would allow us to operate safely and consistently
                    in a wide variety of demanding environments. These procedures have proved to be extremely effective
                    as OceanGate has successfully completed over 14 expeditions and over 200 dives in the Pacific,
                    Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Following every mission, the team evaluates and updates the procedures
                    as part as a continued commitment to evolve and ensure operational safety.

                    The Hewlett-Packard Company, commonly shortened to Hewlett-Packard (/ˈhjuːlɪt ˈpækərd/ HEW-lit
                    PAK-ərd) or HP,
                    was an American multinational information technology company headquartered in Palo Alto,
                    California.
                    HP
                    developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components, as well as software and related
                    services to
                    consumers, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and large enterprises, including customers
                    in
                    the
                    government, health, and education sectors. The company was founded in a one-car garage in Palo
                    Alto
                    by Bill
                    Hewlett and David Packard in 1939, and initially produced a line of electronic test and
                    measurement
                    equipment.
                    The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California Historical
                    Landmark,
                    and is
                    marked with a plaque calling it the "Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'".

                <p id="p4">
                    The company won its first big contract in 1938 to provide test and measurement instruments for
                    Walt
                    Disney's
                    production of the animated film Fantasia, which allowed Hewlett and Packard to formally
                    establish
                    the
                    Hewlett-Packard Company on July 2, 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation
                    widely
                    respected
                    for its products. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter
                    of
                    2013, when
                    Lenovo moved ahead of HP.HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage,
                    and
                    networking hardware; designing software; and delivering services. Major product lines included
                    personal
                    computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking
                    products,
                    software, and a range of printers and other imaging products. The company directly marketed its
                    products to
                    households; small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises, as well as via online
                    distribution;
                    consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers; software partners; and major technology
                    vendors.
                    It also
                    offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner products.

                    Dell is an American multinational computer technology company that develops, sells, repairs, and
                    supports
                    computers and related products and services, and is owned by its parent company of Dell
                    Technologies. Founded
                    in 1984 by Michael Dell, the company is one of the largest technology corporations in the world,
                    employing
                    more than 165,000 people in the U.S. and around the world.

                    Dell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software,
                    computer
                    peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company
                    is
                    well known
                    for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, particularly its
                    direct-sales model
                    and its "build-to-order" or "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual
                    PCs
                    configured to customer specifications.[6][5] Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its
                    existence, but
                    with the acquisition in 2009 of Perot Systems, Dell entered the market for IT services. The
                    company
                    has since
                    made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim of expanding their
                    portfolio from
                    offering computers only to delivering complete solutions[buzzword] for enterprise customers.

                    In 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm EMC Corporation; following the completion
                    of
                    the
                    purchase, Dell and EMC became divisions of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC as a part of Dell
                    Technologies focus on
                    data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other related
                    products and
                    services.
